            <h2>My favourite artists</h2>
            <h3>Claude Monet</h3>
                <p><i>Oscar-Claude Monet</i> was a French painter and founder of
                impressionism painting who is seen as a key precursor
                to modernism, especially in his attempts to paint nature
                as he perceived it.</p>
            <h3>Pablo Picasso</h3>
                <p><i>Pablo Ruiz Picasso</i> was a Spanish painter, sculptor,
                printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent
                most of his adult life in France. One of the most
                influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for
                co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed
                sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the
                wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. </p>
            <h3>Wassily Kandinsky</h3>
                <p><i>Wassily Wassilyevich Kandinsky</i> was a Russian painter and art
                theorist. Kandinsky is generally credited as one of the pioneers
                of abstraction in western art. Kandinsky began painting studies
                (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30.</p>
